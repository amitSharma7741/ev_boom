    "longDescription": "OLA S1 Pro is an electric scooter available at a starting price of Rs. 1,29,999 in India. It is available in only 1 variant and 11 colours. OLA S1 Pro generates 5500 W power from its motor. With both front and rear disc brakes, OLA S1 Pro comes up with combined braking system of both wheels.\n\nThe Ola S1 Pro is the premium variant of the S1 electric scooter range from Ola Electric. This variant of the S1 range packs higher specifications and features more colour options than the standard S1 electric scooter.\n\nThe electric motor on the S1 Pro is tuned to deliver 8.5kW of maximum power and 58Nm of peak torque. The company promises a top speed of 115kmph and claims a range of 181km per full charge as against 90kmph and 121km on the base model. The 3.97kWh battery pack can be fast charged for a range of 75km in 18 minutes. The full charging time is rated at six and a half hours.\n\nThe feature list, similar to the base model, includes a twin-pod headlight at the front, apron-mounted sleek LED indicators, a body-coloured front fender, curvy side panels, a sleek LED taillight, an external charging port at the back, and a split-style pillion grabrail. The scooter features a 36-litre under-seat storage space that can accommodate two open-face helmets. The colour palette for the Pro variant includes 10 options.\n\nStandard features on both models include proximity lock/unlock, remote boot lock, call alert, message alert, infotainment, side-stand alert, anti-theft alert, geo-fencing, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, onboard navigation, limp home mode, reverse mode, get-home mode, take-me-home lights, find my scooter, HMI moods with sound, electronic steering lock, HMI brightness adjuster, welcome screen, OTA updates, manual SOS, and predictive maintenance. The Pro variant further benefits from hill-hold system, cruise control, voice assist, and three ride modes (Normal, Sport, and Hyper).\n\nThe hardware is similar on both variants. Thus, the suspension tasks are handled by a single front fork, a rear mono-shock, disc brakes on both wheels, and a combined braking system"

    "longDescription": " Ather 450X Gen 3 is an electric scooter available at a starting price of Rs. 1,32,058 in India. It is available in 2 variants and 3 colours with top variant price starting from Rs. 1,53,568. Ather 450X Gen 3 generates 3300 W power from its motor. With both front and rear disc brakes, Ather 450X Gen 3 comes up with combined braking system of both wheels.\n\nThe Ather 450X Gen 3 is Ather Energyâ€™s latest flagship model on sale. It was launched in India in July and has quite a few advantages over the previous generation 450 range. The asking price for the Ather 450X is set at Rs 1,55,657 (ex-showroom).\n\nThe Ather 450 Gen 3 looks the same as its predecessor. It features a youthful design with ample modern features. Overall, the scooter appears just as sporty as before with small changes. For instance, the rear-view mirrors have been re-designed for better visibility.\n\nAther has powered the 450X Gen 3 by a 6.2kW motor and a 3.7kWh lithium-ion battery. The latter is a larger unit than before and aids the 450X Gen 3 to clock a claimed 105km range in Eco mode. Meanwhile, the 450 Plus Gen 3 can clock 85km in Eco mode.\n\nAther has equipped the 450X Gen 3 with an updated 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM. This is likely to make the UI faster than before as the previous generation model featured 1GB RAM and 8GB ROM. Ather claims that the 450 Plus Gen 3 can fast-charge for 10km in 10 minutes whereas the 450X Gen 3 can re-charge for 15km in 10 minutes.\n\nThe e-scooter gets Bluetooth connectivity, five riding modes (four for 450 Plus)  Smart Eco, Eco, Ride, Sport and Warp (only for 450X)  LED illumination, parking assist (reverse gear) and a seven-inch touchscreen TFT display.\n\nIt rides on telescopic front forks and a monoshock at the rear. The braking hardware comprises a single disc at both ends with regenerative braking. The Ather 450 rides on 12-inch alloys wrapped in MRF tyres. It tips the scale at 111.6kg and has a 22-litre underseat storage space.\n\nThe Ather 450X and 450 Plus Gen 3 rival the Ola S1 Pro, Revolt RV400, Bajaj Chetak and the TVS iQube Electric."

    "longDescription": "Ampere Magnus Pro comes from an electric hub motor that uses a lead battery pack with a range of 100 km on a single charge in the Eco mode, and 80 km on a single charge in the Cruise mode. The scooter can sprint from 0-40 kmph in 10 seconds and has a top speed of 55 kmph. The electric offering comes with telescopic front forks and dual shock absorbers for improved handling and rideability, while there are drum brakes with regenerative braking. Ampere promises the best-in-class powertrain in the electric scooter commuter segment and claims that it is the lightest vehicle in its category with the highest power-to-weight ratio.\nThe Ampere Magnus Pro comes with ample legroom at the front that stands at 450 mm, which the company claims is more than that on the average petrol-powered scooter. The ground clearance stands at 150 mm, ensuring the scooter can take rough roads with ease. The feature list on the electric scooter is elaborate and includes a LED headlamp, digital instrument console, deep under-seat storage space with an LED light, keyless entry, anti-theft alarm, and Combined Braking System (CBS). The scooter also comes with a Limp home feature that offers an extra 10 km of charge when the battery is down to the last 10 per cent."
