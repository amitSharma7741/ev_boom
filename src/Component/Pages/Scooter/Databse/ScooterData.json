With both front and rear disc brakes, Ather 450X Gen 3 comes up with combined braking system of both wheels.\n\nThe Ather 450X Gen 3 is Ather Energyâ€™s latest flagship model on sale. It was launched in India in July and has quite a few advantages over the previous generation 450 range. The asking price for the Ather 450X is set at Rs 1,55,657 (ex-showroom).\n\nThe Ather 450 Gen 3 looks the same as its predecessor. It features a youthful design with ample modern features. Overall, the scooter appears just as sporty as before with small changes. For instance, the rear-view mirrors have been re-designed for better visibility.\n\nAther has powered the 450X Gen 3 by a 6.2kW motor and a 3.7kWh lithium-ion battery. The latter is a larger unit than before and aids the 450X Gen 3 to clock a claimed 105km range in Eco mode. Meanwhile, the 450 Plus Gen 3 can clock 85km in Eco mode.\n\nAther has equipped the 450X Gen 3 with an updated 2GB RAM and 16GB ROM. This is likely to make the UI faster than before as the previous generation model featured 1GB RAM and 8GB ROM. Ather claims that the 450 Plus Gen 3 can fast-charge for 10km in 10 minutes whereas the 450X Gen 3 can re-charge for 15km in 10 minutes.\n\nThe e-scooter gets Bluetooth connectivity, five riding modes (four for 450 Plus)  Smart Eco, Eco, Ride, Sport and Warp (only for 450X)  LED illumination, parking assist (reverse gear) and a seven-inch touchscreen TFT display.\n\nIt rides on telescopic front forks and a monoshock at the rear. The braking hardware comprises a single disc at both ends with regenerative braking. The Ather 450 rides on 12-inch alloys wrapped in MRF tyres. It tips the scale at 111.6kg and has a 22-litre underseat storage space.\n\nThe Ather 450X and 450 Plus Gen 3 rival the Ola S1 Pro, Revolt RV400, Bajaj Chetak and the TVS iQube Electric."
