An electric vehicle (EV) is a type of vehicle that is powered by an electric motor, rather than a gasoline engine. EV technology has been around for over a century, but it has gained significant popularity in recent years due to concerns about climate change and air pollution. EVs are generally considered to be more environmentally friendly than gasoline-powered vehicles, as they produce zero emissions from their tailpipes and have a lower overall environmental impact during their lifecycle. They also tend to be more energy efficient, as they can convert a higher percentage of their stored energy into motion. EVs come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including cars, buses, and even airplanes.

Despite these advantages, EVs do have some limitations. For example, they can take longer to charge than filling up a gas tank, and their range may be limited compared to traditional vehicles. However, as charging infrastructure improves and battery technology advances, these limitations are becoming less of an issue.
