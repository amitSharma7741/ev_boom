Electric vehicles (EVs) have been gaining popularity in India in recent years, thanks to the government's push for cleaner and more sustainable transportation. However, one of the main concerns for EV owners is the availability and accessibility of charging stations. Finding a charging station can be a challenge, especially when traveling long distances. In this blog post, we will discuss how to find and locate charging stations in India.

The first step in finding a charging station is to use a dedicated app. There are several apps available that can help you locate charging stations near your location. Some popular options include **<a href="https://www.plugshare.com/" target="_blank">PlugShare</a>**, **<a href="https://www.chargepoint.com/" target="_blank">ChargePoint</a>**,or **<a href="https://www.atherenergy.com/grid" target="_blank">Ather Grid</a>**. These apps allow you to filter by type of charging station and view real-time availability information. They also provide reviews and ratings of the charging stations, which can help you make an informed decision.

Another way to find charging stations is by checking the website of the company that operates the charging station you plan to use. Many companies have online maps that show the locations of their charging stations. For example, Tata Power, Fortum Charge and Drive, and Mahindra Electric Mobility Limited all have online maps of their charging stations. This can be a useful tool for planning your route and ensuring that charging stations are available before starting your journey.

If you're looking for information on government-supported charging stations, you can contact the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan (NEMMP). The NEMMP is a government initiative that aims to promote the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles in India. They can provide you with information on the location and availability of charging stations in your area.

The Government of India has also started the FAME India scheme which is Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric vehicles in India. You can refer to their website for information on EV charging stations in India.

Another way to find charging stations is by asking for recommendations from EV owners or EV groups on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and LinkedIn. Many EV owners are more than happy to share their experiences and provide recommendations for charging stations.

It is also important to note that the availability and reliability of charging stations in India may vary. Some charging stations may be out of service or have limited hours of operation. It's always best to plan your route and ensure that charging stations are available before starting your journey. It's also a good idea to have a backup plan in case a charging station is unavailable or is taking longer than expected.

## Conclusion

Finding and locating charging stations in India can be a challenge, but there are several tools and resources available to help you. By using a dedicated app, check with the website of the charging station operator, contacting the NEMMP, referring to the FAME India scheme website, and asking for recommendations from EV owners, you can find charging stations near your location and plan your route accordingly. Remember to always plan your route and ensure that charging stations are available before starting your journey, and have a backup plan in case of unavailability. With the increasing demand for electric vehicles in India, we hope that more charging stations will be made available in the future, making it even easier for EV owners to travel long distances with ease.
