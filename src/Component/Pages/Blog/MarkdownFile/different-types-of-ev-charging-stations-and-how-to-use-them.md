To use a DC fast charging station, you will need to have a CCS (Combined Charging System) or CHAdeMO EVSE cord !! set, which can be purchased at most #EV supply stores. Simply plug one end of the cord into the EVSE and the other end into the #charging station, then connect the EVSE to your EV.

##### Pros:

- Very fast charging times
- Can be used for long-distance trips
