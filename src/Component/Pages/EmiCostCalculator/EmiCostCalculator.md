## What is EMI

EMI stands for **"Equated Monthly Installment."** It is a fixed amount of money that a borrower is required to pay each month to repay a loan. The EMI includes both the principal amount borrowed and the interest charged on the loan. It is calculated using the principal amount, interest rate, and the loan tenure (the length of time over which the loan will be repaid). The EMI is usually paid on a fixed date each month, and the borrower is usually required to make a certain number of payments to fully repay the loan.

The formula to calculate the EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is:

EMI = **[P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]**

Where:

**P** = Principal amount (the amount borrowed)

**R** = Interest rate (per month)

**N** = Loan tenure (number of months)

The interest rate (R) is calculated by dividing the annual interest rate by 12 (number of months in a year).

For example, if you borrow a loan of $20,000 at an annual interest rate of 8% for a period of 5 years (60 months), the EMI calculation would be:

R = 8/12 = 0.67%
N = 60 months
EMI = [20000 x 0.67 x (1+0.67)^60]/[(1+0.67)^60-1]
EMI = $377.42

So, you would need to pay $377.42 per month for 60 months to repay the loan.

It's worth mentioning that there are many online calculators available that will allow you to input the loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure, and will then calculate the EMI for you, you can use it instead of calculating it manually.
