The long-awaited arrival of Hero MotoCorp's first-ever electric two-wheeler, the Hero Vida V1, has finally arrived in India. As the flagship vehicle under Hero's new EV brand, Vida, the Vida V1 offers consumers a choice between two variants - the Pro and Plus. The Pro variant boasts an impressive range of 165 km and an acceleration time of 0-40 kmph in just 3.2 seconds, while the Plus variant offers a range of 143 km and a slightly slower acceleration time of 3.4 seconds. Both scooters can be charged at a lightning-fast rate of 1.2 km per minute and boast a top speed of 80 kmph.

The Vida V1's design is unconventional, boasting a wide front apron and a narrow body at the rear. It also features advanced technologies such as over-the-air updates, a 7-inch touchscreen display, keyless control, cruise control, S.O.S Alert and a two-way throttle. Additionally, both variants offer three riding modes - Eco, Ride & Sports - for a customizable riding experience.

To support the launch of the Vida V1, Hero MotoCorp also introduced the Vida charging network. Bookings for the scooter begin on October 10, 2022, with a booking amount of Rs. 4,999. The Vida V1 will initially be available in select cities such as Delhi, Jaipur and Bengaluru, with plans to expand to the rest of the country in the future. The Vida V1 will be a game-changer in the electric scooter market, and is sure to shake things up for its competitors, such as the Ather 450X and Bajaj Chetak electric
