The Bajaj Chetak electric scooter is a modern and sleek take on the iconic two-wheeler scooter of the same name, which was once produced by Bajaj Auto. With a starting price of Rs. 1,50,081 in India, the Chetak is available in only one variant and six different colors. It boasts a powerful electric motor that generates 3800 W of power and comes equipped with both front disc and rear drum brakes, as well as a combined braking system for enhanced safety and performance.

The design of the Bajaj Chetak is both contemporary and reminiscent of the original model, featuring smooth flowing lines, LED lighting, and turn signals with sequential blinking similar to high-end cars. The scooter also comes equipped with a fully-digital Bluetooth-enabled instrumentation system that offers a host of features.

Powering the Bajaj Chetak is a 3kWh IP67 rated lithium-ion battery and an electric motor with a peak power rating of 4kW and a continuous power rating of 3.8kW, paired with 16Nm of peak torque. The scooter offers two drive modes: Sport and Eco, which provide a range of 95km and 85km, respectively. Bajaj claims that the battery will last for approximately 70,000km before requiring replacement. Additionally, the Chetak features a reverse assist mode, regenerative braking, and an onboard Intelligent Battery Management System (IBMS) to control charge and discharge seamlessly.

The Bajaj Chetak electric scooter is offered in two variants, Urbane and Premium, and comes in a variety of colors including white, pink, black, yellow, red, and blue. It is a formidable competitor in the premium electric scooter market, rivaling models such as the Ather 450 and the Okinawa i-Praise. With its powerful electric motor, innovative features, and sleek design, the Bajaj Chetak is a top choice for electric scooter enthusiasts and commuters alike.
