The TVS iQube is an electric scooter that has recently been launched in India by the manufacturer. It is a state-of-the-art vehicle that is designed to meet the needs of the modern consumer who is looking for a reliable, efficient and eco-friendly mode of transportation. The iQube is available in 2 variants, each with its own unique features and specifications, as well as 7 different color options, giving customers a wide range of choices to suit their personal preferences.

One of the key selling points of the TVS iQube is its powerful motor, which generates 3000 W of power. This allows the scooter to achieve impressive performance and speed, making it suitable for both city commutes and longer distance travel. The iQube is also equipped with front disc and rear drum brakes, providing optimal stopping power and ensuring the safety of the rider.

In terms of design, the TVS iQube is a true blend of form and function. The overall silhouette of the scooter is reminiscent of traditional scooters, but it features a number of modern design touches that give it a futuristic appeal. These include a sleek headlamp and tail lamp design, as well as a U-shaped LED DRL on the handlebar cowl. Additionally, the iQube is designed with practicality in mind, with a roomy seat, spacious footboard, large underseat storage compartment, and luggage hooks. It also comes equipped with an underseat USB charging socket, which allows riders to keep their electronic devices powered up while on the go.

Powering the iQube are three lithium-ion batteries which collectively have a power rating of 2.25kWh. The scooter can be fully charged in around five hours, and the claimed range stands at 75kms. Propelling the scooter is a 4.4kW hub-mounted BLDC motor which produces 140Nm of torque at the wheel. TVS claims it can achieve a top speed of 40kmph in Eco mode and 78kmph in Sport mode while the 0-40kmph acceleration time is 4.2 seconds.

The iQube also comes loaded with features such as full-LED lighting along with a full-color TFT instrument cluster sporting TVSâ€™ SmartXonnect function. This feature allows the rider to connect their display with their smartphone via Bluetooth, giving them access to various information such as ride stats, remote battery range, and geo fencing. The instrument cluster also features a navigation feature and shows incoming call and message notifications. Furthermore, the iQube has been equipped with a Q-Park feature, which helps riders to easily park their vehicle.

The iQube rides on 12-inch wheels which are suspended by telescopic forks up front and dual shock absorbers at the rear. Braking is handled by a disc brake at the front and a drum brake at the rear. The iQube tips the scales at 118kgs.

With the iQube, TVS aims to compete against the Ather 450 and the Bajaj Chetak electric, all of which are currently available only in select cities across India. However, the iQube stands out for its sleek design, powerful motor, and advanced features, making it a strong contender in the electric scooter market. The company is also committed to producing eco-friendly vehicles and has made great efforts to reduce its carbon footprint by using sustainable materials and manufacturing processes. The TVS iQube is a perfect example of this, and it is a great option for anyone looking for a reliable, efficient, and environmentally-friendly mode of transportation.
